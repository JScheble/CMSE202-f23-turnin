This might seem confusing to you. Part of the reason for this is because we skipped a very important step regarding dealing with unfamiliar data, that is **visualizing the data**. \n",

    "**Do this**: Make a scatterplot showing the penguins' body mass vs. bill depth. Color code the dots so that each species gets a different color. Then, display the best fit line for each of the three species using the same color and display the best fit line for all the penguins using a different color. Don't forget to label your axes. When you're done, you should have a plot that contains three different colors of dots and 4 different lines (3 of the lines should match the colors of the three penguin species, respectively)\n",
